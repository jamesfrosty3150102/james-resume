                    <h2>Firmware Engineer at AGTOP technology inc, Taiwan</h2>
                    <p class="subDetails">Jun. 2014 - Present</p>
                    <p>    I served my volunteer life as a tutor teacher in Apr., 2011, in a non-profit organization served in a charity institution in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. </p>
    <p>The first time I went to this place, I had several junior high school students, who were in their last year. I thought they were in very high pressure status, as my status in their age, when my parents, teachers were looking forward that I was able to enroll the top high school in Taipei City.</p>
    <p>Becoming a tutor for these junior high school students, I gradually changed my mind.</p>
    <p>The first time I served as a tutor, my students were not interested in the subjects; therefore even they were able to stay in front of their table with their book, whether they were studying or not was not really important. They were not very care about how many points they earn. Furthermore, living in Taiwan, a country mainly communicate in Mandarin, Chinese, I have been heard so many friends or family members, always complain about their English was poor is because of Taiwan’s whole Chinese environment. So, an idea came into my mine.</p>
    <p>One day, I went to this charity institution, with my laptop, Turned it on and talked to these teenagers, whom were tagged as the children always bully other children: ”Ok, kids, now we have a quiz, please write down the sentence you heard in this video….”</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, I started to play a clip captured from my favorite, classic comic adapted motion picture, The Dark Knight, without Chinese subtitles. The clip was started from Heath Ledger as Joker bumped into Bruce Wayne’s party, the guest were frightened by the noise that Joker shoot a bullet to the ceiling.</p>
<p>Joker: Good evening ladies and gentlemen, we are tonight’s entertainment, only one question, ”Where is Harvey Dent?”</p>
<p>   The classroom became very silent, I saw my screen was received all of attention of these teenagers, with their glory eyes.</p> 
<p>   For these students not familiar with English, I played the clip again and again.</p>
<p>   After the class, I received my questionnaire papers, some students replied :”Is it possible to watch the film all the time?”</p>
<p>    Afterward, I thought it was not quite close to the students, The Dark Knight is the movie I really enjoy, not the students. I discovered the students in charity institution always enjoy the Japanese comic, One Piece, a series of stories about pirates, an idea came to my mind. I went to a bookstore, not easy to find in Taiwan, and bought a comic, actually the same comic “One Piece”, BUT, in English edition, and went to the charity institute again and lent it to them. </p>
<p>These teenagers even asked me what “Bazooka” means. Furthermore, these teenagers took several English – Chinese dictionaries, which they are not interested in their normal life, and asked me to teach them, how to look the vocabularies up in the dictionary, even though, the NGO and the charity institute both have the rules that they cannot read the comic books.</p>
<p>    And there was a very adorable boy, about two grades, got an English story book, and asked me a vocabulary in that book, I found my services really create some special influences to this charity institute.</p>
